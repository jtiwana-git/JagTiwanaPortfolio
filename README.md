# Jag Tiwana Portfolio

My first portfolio that I created during my time at bootcamp

## Desciption of App

First website that I have built, even though the color is bland, this was on purpose as I wanted to focus on the layout of the website - Header, Contents and footer (main components of a website)

## Building the website (Technologies)

The technologies I used was the following

- **HTML** - The **<ins>HyperText Markup Language**</ins> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as <ins>Cascading Style Sheets</ins> and scripting languages such as <ins>JavaScript</ins>.

- **CSS** - **<ins>Cascading Style Sheets</ins>** is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as <ins>HTML</ins>. <ins>CSS</ins> is a cornerstone technology of the **World Wide Web**, alongside <ins>HTML</ins> and <ins>JavaScript</ins>.

- **Bootstrap** - **<ins>Bootstrap</ins>** is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains <ins>CSS</ins>, <ins>HTML</ins> and <ins>JavaScript</ins>-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

- **Font Awesome** - <ins>Font Awesome</ins> is a font and icon toolkit based on CSS and Less. As of 2020, Font Awesome was used by 38% of sites that use third-party font scripts, placing <ins>Font Awesome</ins> in **<em>second place</em>** after <ins>Google Fonts</ins>.
