I had lots of issues, I have spent the entire week doing this

first issues I had was flex box and then footer is not displaying how I wanted and then @media

I will still submit the work and it was given me more determine on doing much better

no point in sending screen shots

after I submit this work, I will practice and revamp the page 

much to learn but I will learn


I have redone the website and will improve the site over the next couple of weeks, adding more contents about myself

I have used the coolers website for the colour palletes (may change this in the future as it looks nice but dull)

See attach for the screenshoots
